## Figure Helix (2025-02)

- **id**: `figure-helix-2025`
- **corpus**: private
- **creator**: Figure AI Inc.
- **disclosure**: Figure AI Inc. 'Helix: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Generalist Humanoid Control'. Public reveal February 2025 via figure.ai/news/helix. Subsequent disclosures: 'Helix Accelerating Real-World Logistics' (figure.ai/news/helix-logistics) and Hacker News + Robot Report coverage. No academic publication; trade-secret commercial VLA.
- **ip status**: trade-secret
- **prior art notes**: Helix is Figure AI's canonical 2025 commercial humanoid VLA. Public-disclosure surface (corporate blog + demo videos + Hacker News + Robot Report coverage) reveals architecture (S1/S2 dual-system, 35-DoF/200Hz, ~500hr teleop training) but withholds neural-network specifics, training-data composition, fine-tuning recipe, and policy-evaluation metrics. The capability set claimed is fully covered by deep open academic prior art chains: (1) S1/S2 dual-system architecture is shared with NVIDIA GR00T N1 (round-15 entry, released within weeks; the cognitive-science S1/S2 pattern dates to Kahneman 'Thinking Fast and Slow' 2011); (2) high-rate continuous VLA control was demonstrated by π₀ (round-12, October 2024) and π₀.₅ (round-12, April 2025) in diffusion/flow-matching form; (3) onboard low-power VLA inference is anticipated by OpenVLA-OFT (round-12, parallel decoding + 26× throughput); (4) multi-robot collaboration is anticipated by ROS 2 (round-13, real-time multi-vehicle middleware) and the Mobile ALOHA / ACT bimanual lineage. Direct shielding for any Helix or Helix-derivative commercial-IP claim.

## NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 (2025-03)

- **id**: `nvidia-groot-n1-2025`
- **corpus**: academic
- **creator**: NVIDIA; multi-author research team
- **disclosure**: NVIDIA. 'GR00T N1: An Open Foundation Model for Generalist Humanoid Robots'. arXiv:2503.14734, March 2025. NVIDIA GTC 2025 announcement. Open commercial license; open weights via HuggingFace nvidia/GR00T-N1-2B. Successor versions N1.6 (full-body) and N1.7 (Cosmos-Reason2 + EgoScale 20K-hour egocentric pre-training) released subsequently.
- **ip status**: open-permissive
- **prior art notes**: NVIDIA GR00T N1 is the canonical first open commercial-licensed humanoid foundation model (GTC March 2025). 2-month-deep open prior art for: dual-system S1/S2 humanoid VLA, egocentric-human-video pre-training at scale, NVIDIA Isaac platform integration. Direct architectural sibling of Figure Helix (round-15 entry). Both adopt the dual-system pattern from cognitive science. The N1.7 EgoScale 20K-hour pre-training corpus is itself prior art for any commercial humanoid claim on egocentric-video-trained policy datasets. Direct shielding for any commercial humanoid VLA claim.
