**Cross-cut tag:** `control-bimanual-manipulation`

## How to use this packet

This document is an invalidity-contention packet — a chronologically-ordered
list of every disclosed prior art reference in the Free Humanoid Corpus that
bears on the subsystem `control-bimanual-manipulation`.

To use it:

1. Identify the patent claim element being challenged.
2. Match the element against the entries below in chronological order (earliest
   first). The earliest entry that discloses the element is the strongest 102
   anticipation candidate.
3. For 103 obviousness contentions, identify the closest two-or-more entries
   that together disclose all claim elements.
4. Each entry's **prior_art_notes** field is element-by-element 102/103
   anticipation analysis — citable as-is.
5. Verify the timestamp authority via the procedures in Verification (below).

cite, copy, or redistribute these contentions.

## Entries (chronological)

### 2024-10 — RDT-1B (Robotics Diffusion Transformer)

- **id:** `rdt-1b-thu-2024`
- **corpus:** academic
- **ip status:** open-permissive
- **creator:** Tsinghua TSAIL (THU-ML); Songming Liu et al.
- **disclosure citation:** Liu, S., et al. 'RDT-1B: a Diffusion Foundation Model for Bimanual Manipulation'. arXiv:2410.07864, October 2024. ICLR 2025. Tsinghua TSAIL (THU-ML) lab.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `control-vla-vision-language-action`, `control-foundation-model-policy`, `control-diffusion-policy`, `control-imitation-learning`, `control-bimanual-manipulation`

**Prior art notes:**

> RDT-1B is THU-ML's canonical diffusion-based VLA foundation model for bimanual manipulation (ICLR 2025). 7-month-deep open-permissive prior art for: diffusion-formulation VLA at billion-parameter scale, bimanual manipulation foundation policy, multi-robot pre-training corpus. The canonical Chinese-academy entry in the open-weight VLA race alongside Stanford OpenVLA and Physical Intelligence π₀. Directly cited as a comparison baseline in OpenVLA-OFT (round-12); now resolves correctly. Direct shielding for any commercial humanoid claim on diffusion-based bimanual VLA.

### 2025-02 — Figure Helix

- **id:** `figure-helix-2025`
- **corpus:** private
- **ip status:** trade-secret
- **creator:** Figure AI Inc.
- **disclosure citation:** Figure AI Inc. 'Helix: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Generalist Humanoid Control'. Public reveal February 2025 via figure.ai/news/helix. Subsequent disclosures: 'Helix Accelerating Real-World Logistics' (figure.ai/news/helix-logistics) and Hacker News + Robot Report coverage. No academic publication; trade-secret commercial VLA.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `control-vla-vision-language-action`, `control-foundation-model-policy`, `control-dual-system-architecture`, `control-high-rate-continuous-control`, `control-bimanual-manipulation`, `control-multi-robot-coordination`

**Prior art notes:**

> Helix is Figure AI's canonical 2025 commercial humanoid VLA. Public-disclosure surface (corporate blog + demo videos + Hacker News + Robot Report coverage) reveals architecture (S1/S2 dual-system, 35-DoF/200Hz, ~500hr teleop training) but withholds neural-network specifics, training-data composition, fine-tuning recipe, and policy-evaluation metrics. The capability set claimed is fully covered by deep open academic prior art chains: (1) S1/S2 dual-system architecture is shared with NVIDIA GR00T N1 (round-15 entry, released within weeks; the cognitive-science S1/S2 pattern dates to Kahneman 'Thinking Fast and Slow' 2011); (2) high-rate continuous VLA control was demonstrated by π₀ (round-12, October 2024) and π₀.₅ (round-12, April 2025) in diffusion/flow-matching form; (3) onboard low-power VLA inference is anticipated by OpenVLA-OFT (round-12, parallel decoding + 26× throughput); (4) multi-robot collaboration is anticipated by ROS 2 (round-13, real-time multi-vehicle middleware) and the Mobile ALOHA / ACT bimanual lineage. Direct shielding for any Helix or Helix-derivative commercial-IP claim.

## Verification

This packet's entries are anchored by the Free Humanoid Corpus 2026.Q2
release with three independent cryptographic timestamps proving
pre-existence:

- **FreeTSA RFC 3161** — `releases/2026.Q2/freetsa.tsr` in the corpus repo
- **DigiCert RFC 3161** — `releases/2026.Q2/digicert.tsr`
- **OpenTimestamps Bitcoin-anchored** — `releases/2026.Q2/corpus-2026.Q2.tar.gz.ots`,
  with Bitcoin block headers at heights **948142** (bob),
  **948151** (eternitywall), and **948161** (catallaxy).

The full release tarball SHA-256 is `aa9430c6e785a409e3dbb10042b16e0e5677752c85eeffcba2c6b5605cde27ce`,
archived on Zenodo at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20049531>.

Anyone with a Bitcoin block explorer can independently verify that the corpus
tarball — containing all entries cited in this packet — existed at or before
the timestamps anchored in those blocks.
