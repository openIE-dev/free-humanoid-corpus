**Generated:** 2026-05-07  
**Cross-cut tag:** `actuator-electric`

## How to use this packet

This document is an invalidity-contention packet — a chronologically-ordered
list of every disclosed prior art reference in the Free Humanoid Corpus that
bears on the subsystem `actuator-electric`.

To use it:

1. Identify the patent claim element being challenged.
2. Match the element against the entries below in chronological order (earliest
   first). The earliest entry that discloses the element is the strongest 102
   anticipation candidate.
3. For 103 obviousness contentions, identify the closest two-or-more entries
   that together disclose all claim elements.
4. Each entry's **prior_art_notes** field is element-by-element 102/103
   anticipation analysis — citable as-is.
5. Verify the timestamp authority via the procedures in Verification (below).

## Entries (chronological)

### 2016-06 — Boston Dynamics SpotMini

- **id:** `boston-dynamics-spotmini-2017`
- **corpus:** private
- **ip status:** trade-secret
- **creator:** Boston Dynamics
- **disclosure citation:** Boston Dynamics. SpotMini public reveal June 2016 demo video; subsequent IEEE Spectrum coverage 2017-2018; capability demonstrations via Boston Dynamics YouTube. Discontinued in favor of Spot (the production quadruped) circa 2019.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `mechanism-quadrupedal-locomotion`, `actuator-electric`, `control-rl-policy`, `control-teleoperation`

**Prior art notes:**

> SpotMini is the architectural predecessor to commercial Spot. ~9-year-deep public-disclosure prior art for: all-electric quadruped morphology (distinct from hydraulic BigDog/Spot ancestors), dorsal-mount manipulator on quadruped base, Velodyne+depth-camera quadruped sensor stack. Trade-secret control software, public capability surface. Direct shielding for any commercial humanoid-quadruped or quadruped-manipulator claim. Cited in cheetah-cub-epfl and black-mirror-metalhead-2017 prior_art_notes; round-14 backfill closes those citation chains.

**Sources:**

1. Boston Dynamics YouTube reveal videos June 2016 and 2018.
2. IEEE Spectrum 'Boston Dynamics' SpotMini Is All Electric, Agile, and Has a Capable Face-Arm', 2017.
3. Vision Systems Design coverage 2018.

### 2025-10 — Tesla Optimus Gen 3 *(draft)*

- **id:** `tesla-optimus-gen3-2025`
- **corpus:** private
- **ip status:** trade-secret
- **creator:** Tesla, Inc.
- **disclosure citation:** Tesla, Inc. Optimus Gen 3 product disclosures via Tesla AI Day-class demonstrations + product page (tesla.com/we-robot) + Optimus blog/social-media posts October 2025+. Trade-secret commercial humanoid platform.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `mechanism-bipedal-locomotion`, `mechanism-anthropomorphic-hand`, `mechanism-tendon-driven`, `actuator-electric`, `control-vision-only-perception`, `control-foundation-model-policy`, `sensing-fingertip-tactile`

**Prior art notes:**

> Tesla Optimus Gen 3 is the dominant commercial humanoid product claim surface. Public-disclosure surface (Tesla product page + demos + social-media + investor decks) discloses dimensional specs and high-level architecture; withholds actuator architecture, specific neural-network policies, training-data composition, and on-device inference details. **The 22-DoF hand × 50-actuator claim is the most specific architectural claim** and directly engages prior-art chains in the corpus: Shadow Hand (24-DoF), DLR Hand-II (15-DoF), Pisa-IIT SoftHand (synergy reduction), Tactile SoftHand-A (antagonistic tendons + tactile fingertips, round-11 entry — directly anticipates the tactile-fingertip delicate-manipulation claim), Educational SoftHand-A (round-12 entry — clutch-gear synergy mechanism). Modern claims on tactile-fingertip dexterous manipulation face 2-year-deep tactile-softhand-a prior art and the deeper SoftHand chain back to 2014. Vision-only sensing is shielded by Tesla's own FSD patents (which Tesla cannot use offensively against an own-lineage humanoid claim) but separately by Levine's GPS PR2/BRETT (2016) for vision-driven manipulation. The full Optimus Gen 3 claim surface is therefore element-by-element anticipated by deep open academic chains plus prior commercial humanoids in the corpus.

## Verification

This packet's entries are anchored by the Free Humanoid Corpus 2026.Q2
release with three independent cryptographic timestamps proving
pre-existence:

- **FreeTSA RFC 3161** — `releases/2026.Q2/freetsa.tsr` in the corpus repo
- **DigiCert RFC 3161** — `releases/2026.Q2/digicert.tsr`
- **OpenTimestamps Bitcoin-anchored** — `releases/2026.Q2/corpus-2026.Q2.tar.gz.ots`,
  with Bitcoin block headers at heights **948142** (bob),
  **948151** (eternitywall), and **948161** (catallaxy).

The full release tarball SHA-256 is `aa9430c6e785a409e3dbb10042b16e0e5677752c85eeffcba2c6b5605cde27ce`,
archived on Zenodo at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20049531>.

Anyone with a Bitcoin block explorer can independently verify that the corpus
tarball — containing all entries cited in this packet — existed at or before
the timestamps anchored in those blocks.
