## How to use this packet

This document is an invalidity-contention packet — a chronologically-ordered
list of every disclosed prior art reference in the Free Humanoid Corpus that
bears on the subsystem `mechanism-syntactic-foam-ballast`.

To use it:

1. Identify the patent claim element being challenged.
2. Match the element against the entries below in chronological order (earliest
   first). The earliest entry that discloses the element is the strongest 102
   anticipation candidate.
3. For 103 obviousness contentions, identify the closest two-or-more entries
   that together disclose all claim elements.
4. Each entry's **prior_art_notes** field is element-by-element 102/103
   anticipation analysis — citable as-is.
5. Verify the timestamp authority via the procedures in Verification (below).

The Free Humanoid Corpus is licensed CC0 1.0; no permission is required to
cite, copy, or redistribute these contentions.

## Entries (chronological)

### 1964-06 — DSV Alvin

- **id:** `alvin-hov-1964`
- **corpus:** academic
- **ip status:** public-domain
- **creator:** Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution / Allyn Vine concept (1956); General Mills Mechanical Division built v1
- **disclosure citation:** Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. DSV Alvin operational since June 1964; first published 4500 m dive Aug 1973. Extensive academic publication record via WHOI deep-submergence vehicle group: Ballard 1985 (Titanic dives), Yoerger et al. mission reports 1991+, Kohnen ed. 'Manned Submersibles' (1978). Operational and design details in the public domain via U.S. Navy / WHOI.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `mechanism-pressure-hull`, `mechanism-syntactic-foam-ballast`, `mechanism-variable-ballast-trim`, `mechanism-thruster-vectored`, `mechanism-manipulator-arm`, `control-station-keeping`, `control-teleoperation`

**Prior art notes:**

> DSV Alvin is the foundational manned deep-submergence vehicle. Its 60-year operational record establishes essentially every architectural element of modern submersible robotics as long-anticipated prior art: titanium pressure-hull design at 4500 m+ depth (1973), syntactic-foam buoyancy matched to depth pressure, variable-ballast trim tanks, vectored-thruster station-keeping, master-slave manipulator pairs for sample collection. Directly shields free-humanoid-submersible commitments on: 50 m pressure hull (62 years deeper than Alvin's 1964 baseline), 8-thruster vectored layout (the 6-thruster Alvin pattern is the lower bound), bimanual manipulator architecture (Alvin's Schilling/Kraft 7-function arms are the ROV-class equivalent of the bipedal upper body). Any commercial humanoid AUV claim on these elements faces a 62-year-deep public-domain academic lineage with extensive WHOI publication.

### 2008-05 — Nereus HROV

- **id:** `nereus-hrov-2008`
- **corpus:** academic
- **ip status:** public-domain
- **creator:** WHOI Deep Submergence Laboratory; Bowen / Yoerger / Whitcomb
- **disclosure citation:** Bowen, A. D., Yoerger, D. R., Taylor, C., et al. 'The Nereus Hybrid Underwater Robotic Vehicle for Global-Class Ocean Science', WHOI Deep Submergence Laboratory; OCEANS 2008. First Challenger Deep dive (10,902 m) May 2009. Lost during operations May 2014 at 9,990 m.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `mechanism-pressure-hull`, `mechanism-syntactic-foam-ballast`, `mechanism-thruster-vectored`, `mechanism-manipulator-arm`, `control-mode-switching`, `control-tethered-teleoperation`, `control-acoustic-comms`, `control-dvl-positioning`, `power-pressure-balanced-li-ion`

**Prior art notes:**

> Nereus is the canonical academic hybrid AUV/ROV. Establishes 6-year-deep public-domain prior art for: dual-mode AUV-ROV operation in a single hull, lightweight expendable fiber tether (no power conductor), pressure-balanced subsea Li-ion at full ocean depth, ceramic-sphere syntactic-foam buoyancy to 11 km. Directly shields free-humanoid-submersible's potential mode-switching commitments and pressure-balanced power architecture. Any commercial humanoid AUV claiming mode-switching as novel art faces a 16-year-deep WHOI academic lineage with explicit publication of every mechanism.

## Verification

This packet's entries are anchored by the Free Humanoid Corpus 2026.Q2
release with three independent cryptographic timestamps proving
pre-existence:

- **FreeTSA RFC 3161** — `releases/2026.Q2/freetsa.tsr` in the corpus repo
- **DigiCert RFC 3161** — `releases/2026.Q2/digicert.tsr`
- **OpenTimestamps Bitcoin-anchored** — `releases/2026.Q2/corpus-2026.Q2.tar.gz.ots`,
  with Bitcoin block headers at heights **948142** (bob),
  **948151** (eternitywall), and **948161** (catallaxy).

The full release tarball SHA-256 is `aa9430c6e785a409e3dbb10042b16e0e5677752c85eeffcba2c6b5605cde27ce`,
archived on Zenodo at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20049531>.

Anyone with a Bitcoin block explorer can independently verify that the corpus
tarball — containing all entries cited in this packet — existed at or before
the timestamps anchored in those blocks.
